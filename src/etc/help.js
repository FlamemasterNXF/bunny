This fighter will be sent to the gold box and its stats will be used in battle!<br>When your fighter reaches 0% HP, it is <b>knocked out</b> and another Bunny from your team with at least 50% HP will be sent to replace it.<br>Bunnies on your team with less than 100% HP are healed at a rate proportional to their Max HP. The most recently knocked out Bunny is prioritized.<br><br>Every <b>Stage</b> requires you to beat 10 enemies to complete (this is different for Stages 1-9).<br>Upon completing a Stage, you will receive a new Bunny! This Bunny\'s stats are increased based on the Stage number, but there is also some randomness involved :)<br>More information on Bunny stats can be found in the <b>Paragon Fusion</b> help page!',

The first three are self-explanatory, but <b>Luck</b> is special! <b>Luck</b> directly increases your odds of finding Bunnies of higher rarity upon completing a <b>Stage</b>!<br>More information on <b>Stages</b> can be found in the <b>Combat</b> help page!',
